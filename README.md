# GeekOn.tech

A collection of fairly technical articles.

# Writing

We are using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) as the blogging engine. Go ahead and install it.

Now after that, clone the repo and run `hugo server --buildDrafts --theme=redlounge` to get a local version of the site working.

Now do `hugo new post/x-y-z.md` and start writing! Add any static content to `static/` folder.

Once done, commit and send in a PR.

If stuck, open an [issue](https://github.com/Gouthamve/geekon.tech/issues) or go through the hugo docs.
